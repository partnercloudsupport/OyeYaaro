flutter:

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/searchGroup.png
    - assets/images.jpg
    # - assets/mimi2.gif
    - assets/no_img.png
    # - assets/logo.jpg
    - assets/dart.png
    - assets/video_call.png
    - assets/short.png
    - assets/ic_shutter_1.png
    - assets/ic_switch_camera_3.png
    - assets/music.png
    - assets/ic_record_stop.png
    - assets/ic_music_select.png
    - assets/video-camera-icon.png
    - assets/stop-flat.png

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Raleway
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Raleway-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Raleway-Medium.ttf
  #         weight: 500
  #       - asset: assets/fonts/Raleway-SemiBold.ttf
  #         weight: 600
  #    - family: Schyler
  #      fonts:
  #        - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #        - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #          style: italic
  #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
